# Funcionality Notes:
permissions:

if enrolled in 1-1 class -> have chat for that class
if enrolled in group -> have chat for grou
if both group and 1-1 -> have access to both

# Client Context About Workflow/Feature Need:
Client problem context:

Private (1:1) students need way to communicate with teacher(s)
Group class students should not have private messaging access


Outcomes we want:

Make sure when class has 2 teachers both of them are in the chat with students
Admins should be in all chats
Notify teachers on email when student sends question
Have an opt-in for student to receive email notifications for chat


Steven Notes

I would differentiate between 
Group / Private messages 

# Some Use Cases:
- Private class students can message their teacher directly
- When a private lesson student messages their teacher, the teacher/admin can respond through the portal
