# Funcionality Notes:
i would also use messages section - https://v0-student-learning-portal-amber.vercel.app/

group chat - see 1-1 chat for roles

# Client Context About Workflow/Feature Need:
Client problem context:

Group students need way to communicate with classmates and teachers


Outcomes we want:

Make sure when class has 2 teachers both of them are in the chat with students
Admins should be in all chats
Notify teachers on email when students send questions/messages
Have an opt-in for students to receive email notifications for chat

Solution Notes

Would add another tab to the teacher portal 
"Chats" 

# Some Use Cases:
- When a group student posts a question in their cohort discussion, teacher & admins can respond & all classmates see the answer
- Group students can send messages in the class/cohort discussion chat.
