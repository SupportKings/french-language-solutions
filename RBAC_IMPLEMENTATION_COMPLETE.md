# RBAC Implementation - Complete ✅

## Summary

Successfully implemented a comprehensive Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system for the French Language Solutions platform with **2 roles** (`admin` and `teacher`) using Better Auth's access control system.

---

## ✅ What Was Implemented

### 1. **Permission System** (`src/lib/permissions.ts`)
- **Removed** all old roles (user, coach, premiereCoach, cpo, csManager, csRep, csc, finance, billingAdmin, salesRep)
- **Created** 2 new roles:
  - **`teacher`**: Restricted access - only sees assigned students, cohorts, and all assessments
  - **`admin`**: Full access to everything

- **New Permission Categories**:
  ```typescript
  students: ["read", "write", "read_all", "read_assigned"]
  cohorts: ["read", "write", "read_all", "read_assigned"]
  assessments: ["read", "write", "read_all"]
  teachers: ["read", "write", "read_all"]
  enrollments: ["read", "write", "read_all"]
  automation: ["read", "write"]
  system: ["configure", "churn_rate_configure", "activation_dropoff_configure"]
  ```

### 2. **RBAC Middleware** (`src/lib/rbac-middleware.ts`)
Complete middleware with:
- ✅ Authentication helpers (`requireAuth`, `requireAdmin`)
- ✅ Role checks (`isAdmin`, `isTeacher`)
- ✅ Permission checks (`hasPermission`, `requirePermission`)
- ✅ Teacher data access (`getTeacherIdFromSession`, `getCurrentUserCohortIds`)
- ✅ Access validators (`canAccessStudent`, `canAccessCohort`)
- ✅ Data filters (`applyCohortFilter`, `filterStudentsByAccess`)

### 3. **Sidebar Navigation** (`src/components/sidebar/app-sidebar.tsx`)
Updated to dynamically show/hide sections:

**Teachers See:**
- Students Hub (with Students & Assessments only)
- Classes Hub (Cohorts)

**Admins See:**
- Students Hub (Students/Leads, Enrollments, Assessments)
- Classes Hub (Cohorts)
- Team Members
- Automation
- Configuration

### 4. **Protected API Routes**

#### Students API (`src/app/api/students/route.ts` & `[id]/route.ts`)
- ✅ `GET /api/students` - Lists students (filtered by teacher's cohorts)
- ✅ `GET /api/students/[id]` - Get single student (access check)
- ✅ `POST /api/students` - Create student (authenticated users)
- ✅ `PATCH /api/students/[id]` - Update student (access check)
- ✅ `DELETE /api/students/[id]` - Delete student (access check)

#### Cohorts API (`src/app/api/cohorts/route.ts` & `[id]/route.ts`)
- ✅ `GET /api/cohorts` - Lists cohorts (filtered by teacher's assignments)
- ✅ `GET /api/cohorts/[id]` - Get single cohort (access check)
- ✅ `POST /api/cohorts` - Create cohort (authenticated users)
- ✅ `PATCH /api/cohorts/[id]` - Update cohort (access check)
- ✅ `DELETE /api/cohorts/[id]` - Delete cohort (admin only)

### 5. **Auth Configuration**
- Updated `src/lib/auth.ts` to only use `teacher` and `admin` roles
- Updated `src/lib/auth-client.ts` to only use `teacher` and `admin` roles
- Updated user creation flow to use new roles

### 6. **Documentation**
Created comprehensive guides:
- ✅ `/RBAC_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Implementation overview and testing plan
- ✅ `/API_RBAC_EXAMPLES.md` - 8+ practical examples for all API patterns
- ✅ `/RBAC_IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md` - This summary document

## 🔑 How It Works

### Access Control Flow

```
1. Authentication
   ↓
   requireAuth() → Check if user is logged in
   ↓
2. Authorization
   ↓
   isAdmin() → Is user admin?
   ├─ YES → Full access to all data
   └─ NO  → Continue to filtering
   ↓
3. Data Filtering
   ↓
   For Teachers:
   ├─ getTeacherIdFromSession() → Get teacher record
   ├─ getCurrentUserCohortIds() → Get assigned cohort IDs
   └─ filterStudentsByAccess() → Filter students by cohorts
```

### Teacher Data Access

Teachers can only access:
- **Students**: Only those enrolled in their assigned cohorts (via `weekly_sessions`)
- **Cohorts**: Only cohorts they teach (via `weekly_sessions`)
- **Assessments**: All assessments (no restriction)

Admins can access:
- **Everything**: No restrictions

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### Admin User Testing
- [ ] Can see all navigation sections
- [ ] Can access `/api/students` - sees all students
- [ ] Can access `/api/cohorts` - sees all cohorts
- [ ] Can access configuration and automation sections
- [ ] Can delete cohorts

### Teacher User Testing
- [ ] Only sees: Students Hub, Classes Hub, Assessments in sidebar
- [ ] Cannot see: Team Members, Enrollments, Configuration, Automation
- [ ] Can access `/api/students` - only sees students in their cohorts
- [ ] Can access `/api/cohorts` - only sees their assigned cohorts
- [ ] Can access all assessments
- [ ] Cannot delete cohorts (403 error)

### Teacher + Admin Role (Dual Role)
- [ ] Has full admin access
- [ ] Sees all students and cohorts
- [ ] Can access all admin sections

### Real-time Access Changes
- [ ] When teacher is removed from a cohort (weekly_sessions deleted):
  - Students in that cohort disappear from their list
  - Cohort disappears from their list
- [ ] Changes happen immediately (no caching delay)

## 🚀 Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

### Immediate Priorities
1. **Test the implementation** with real users (admin and teacher accounts)
2. **Verify database indexes** exist on:
   - `teachers.user_id`
   - `weekly_sessions.teacher_id`
   - `enrollments.cohort_id`

### Future Enhancements
1. **Add more API routes**: Apply the same pattern to:
   - Assessments routes (if not already protected)
   - Enrollments routes (admin only)
   - Team members routes (admin only)
   - Automation routes (admin only)
   - Configuration routes (admin only)

2. **Add Server Actions protection**: Apply RBAC to server actions using:
   ```typescript
   import { requireAuth, canAccessStudent } from "@/lib/rbac-middleware";

   export const updateStudentAction = actionClient
     .schema(studentSchema)
     .action(async ({ parsedInput }) => {
       await requireAuth();
       const hasAccess = await canAccessStudent(parsedInput.id);
       if (!hasAccess) throw new Error("Forbidden");
       // ... continue
     });
   ```

3. **Add Client-Side Checks**: Use in React components:
   ```typescript
   const { data: session } = useSession();
   const isAdmin = session?.user?.role === "admin";

   if (!isAdmin) {
     return <AccessDenied />;
   }
   ```

4. **Add Audit Logging**: Track who accessed what data

5. **Add Rate Limiting**: Prevent abuse of API endpoints

---

## 💡 Usage Examples

### API Route Example
```typescript
// /api/students/route.ts
export async function GET(request: NextRequest) {
  // 1. Require authentication
  const session = await requireAuth();

  // 2. Fetch all students (including enrollments)
  const { data } = await supabase
    .from("students")
    .select("*, enrollments(*)");

  // 3. Apply RBAC filtering (admins see all, teachers see filtered)
  const filteredData = await filterStudentsByAccess(data, session);

  return NextResponse.json({ data: filteredData });
}
```

### Single Resource Access Check
```typescript
// /api/students/[id]/route.ts
export async function GET(request: NextRequest, { params }) {
  const { id } = await params;

  // Check access
  const hasAccess = await canAccessStudent(id);
  if (!hasAccess) {
    return NextResponse.json({ error: "Forbidden" }, { status: 403 });
  }

  // Fetch data
  const { data } = await supabase
    .from("students")
    .select("*")
    .eq("id", id)
    .single();

  return NextResponse.json(data);
}
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Admin Role Overrides Everything**: If a user has `role === "admin"`, they bypass all teacher restrictions, even if they also have a teacher record.

2. **Real-time Access**: Access is based on current database state. Removing a teacher from a cohort (deleting weekly_sessions) immediately removes their access.

3. **Assessments Are Global**: All teachers can access all assessments (as per requirements).

4. **No "User" Role**: The old "user" role has been completely removed and replaced with "teacher".

5. **TypeScript Type Safety**: All changes are fully typed and compile without errors.
